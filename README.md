# The Lizards Lair Snippet Manager
A very simple little snippet manager extension for Visual Studio 2019. All snippets are saved as txt files in a directory of your choice. No need to register, no need to be online, no extra bells or whistles. Its quick and easy to save the code and quick and easy to put it into the code where you want it.

I made this one after i couldnt find just a simple snippet manager without a million bells and whistles that did a million things i didnt want it to do.
