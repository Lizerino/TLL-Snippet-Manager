# The Lizards Lair Snippet Manager
A very simple little snippet manager extension for Visual Studio 2019. All snippets are saved as txt files in a directory of your choice. Nothing online, no registration, no support.

I made this one after i couldnt find just a simple snippet manager without a million bells and whistles that did a million things i didnt want it to do.
